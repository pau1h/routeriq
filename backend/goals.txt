Things to do today:

1. Connect / disconnect events should not be sent out when program is first run	
	* Maybe make an overloaded fetchDevices function with a "clean" arg that doesnt trigger events. Frontend calls that first.
2. Work on frontend. On first run, it should ask you for ip address
3. Settings page for adjusting ip address and fetch devices rate

Goals:
1.	Clean frontend. Visual representation of devices connected to the network, based on length from router. 
	* Each device is a little bubble. If you click on the bubble, you should be brought to a page where you can create a rule based on whether or not theyre connected. 
	* Should be able to execute a JS file or python script for that rule possibly. Or just send an email.
	* Should be able to label devices
2. Whole service should be a docker image or just generally easy to setup
3. Rules based on how long someone has been inactive for


Notes:
Maybe on first run, run a separate function that updates the database without triggering rules. That function calls the insertOrUpdate func afterwards which runs every few seconds.
The way we can trigger rules could just be that for each rule we check the database for the status, and if its true, trigger the rule. Need a rule class and a database. Check status for each rule, and check current state of IOT device before triggering anything.
I think honestly what I start off doing is making a front end where I can select devices.
